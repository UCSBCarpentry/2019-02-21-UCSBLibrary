Hello again everyone.

We are looking forward to seeing you on Thursday and Friday.

Bagels, cream cheese, tea and coffee will be served at 8:30.

The workshop will start at 9:00am SHARP! We have a lot of material to go through, so sticking to our schedule is imperative.

Please, please, please have all your software installed before you come.  There are detailed setup instructions on the workshop website: (https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2019-02-21-UCSBLibrary/index.html#setup)

If you encounter problems, come by early.  We, and breakfast, will be available to help starting at 8:15.

If you haven't already, please take a moment to fill out our pre-workshop survey so that we can better tailor this and future workshops to your needs:
